## Programing principle

Why Python?

    Python has many well elaborate open-source libraries in optimization area.

Required libraries and reasons?

    numpy, scipy: for linear algebra and solving linear system equation.
    mpi4py: providing distributed functions.
    cvxpy: providing proximal solutions.
